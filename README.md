Abstract:
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a crucial metric that measures daily air pollution levels, indicating how clean or polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be a concern.
Our primary goal is to analyse historical AQI data, predict future trends, and assess their potential health impacts, thereby contributing to informed decision-making for a healthier urban environment.

Air pollution has become one of the most serious environmental challenges in India, especially across major urban regions. To understand the patterns, sources, and severity of air quality issues, this project analyzes daily AQI (Air Quality Index) data from 2015 to 2020 for multiple Indian cities. The dataset contains key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, which significantly contribute to air pollution levels.
The project focuses on cleaning the dataset, removing inconsistencies, filling missing values, and preparing the data for meaningful analysis. A series of visualizations—such as trends over time, city-wise comparisons, pollutant correlations, and seasonal heatmaps—are used to identify pollution hotspots, seasonal variations, and major pollutant contributors.
Additionally, 2024 AQI data for six major metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad) is analyzed separately to compare recent air quality trends. Overall, the study provides insights into air pollution patterns, the most affected cities, critical pollutants, and how air quality has changed in recent years.
